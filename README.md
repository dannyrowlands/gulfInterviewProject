I have spent as much time on this as I can spare as I have my son (7 years old) with me for half term, limiting the amount of time I can commit to this.

To complete this task I would use artisan tinker and unit tests to confirm the correct operation of the data models.

I would then be looking to create routes within the api middleware (add the appropriate routes to the routes/api.php file).  Appropriate tests facilitating this would be also written.

After doing so I would create Controller and required classes (with interfaces) to process and return the data requested via api from the data models.


I would love to have been able to spend more time on this, I am confident we would have had a good rubust, fully testable application on completion.  

I hope what I have shown is a good representation of my working practices.
